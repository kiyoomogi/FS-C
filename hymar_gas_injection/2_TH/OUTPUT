 &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

 Modification of absolute permeability on a grid block-by-grid block basis will be made when a domain "SEED " is present in data
 block "ROCKS", as follows.
                                    k    --->    k' = k*m

 Here, k is the absolute permeability specified for the reservoir domain to which the grid block belongs. Parameter m is a
 "permeability modifier" which can be internally generated or externally prescribed by the user on a block-by-block basis.

 When permeability modification is in effect, the strength of capillary pressure will, following Leverett (1941), automatically be
 scaled as   Pcap ---> Pcap' = Pcap/SQRT(m).

 User-supplied permeability modifiers have to be entered as parameter "PMX" in columns 41-50 of an ELEMEnt record.
 Permeability modification options are selected through parameters in data block "ROCKS".

 Summary of available permeability modification options

      (1) externally supplied:        m = PMX - PER(2)
      (2) "linear"      (DROK.ne.0):  m = PER(1) * s - PER(2)
      (3) "logarithmic" (DROK.eq.0):  m = exp(- PER(1) * s) - PER(2)
 &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

            &&&& if a domain "SEED " is present, permeability modification will be made

 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>  domain = "SEED " is not present, no permeability modification will be made  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

 Data provided in domain "SEED " are used to select the following options.

 DROK   = *** random number seed for internal generation of "linear" permeability modifiers.
        = 0: (default) no internal generation of "linear" permeability modifiers.
        > 0: perform "linear" permeability modification; random modifiers are generated internally with DROK as seed.

 POR    = *** random number seed for internal generation of "logarithmic" permeability modifiers,
        = 0: (default) no internal generation of "logarithmic" permeability modifiers.
        > 0: perform "logarithmic" permeability modification; random modifiers are generated internally with POR as seed.

            &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
            &&&&& note: if both DROK and POR are specified as non-zero, DROK takes precedence                                  &&&&&

            &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

 PER(1) = *** scale factor (optional) for internally generated  permeability modifiers.
        = 0: (defaults to PER(1) = 1): permeability modifiers are generated as random numbers in the interval (0, 1).
        > 0: permeability modifiers are generated as random numbers in the interval (0, PER(1)).

 PER(2) = *** shift (optional) for internal or external permeability modifiers.
        = 0: (default) no shift is applied to permeability modifiers.
        > 0: permeability modifiers are shifted according to m' = m - PER(2). All m' < 0 are set equal to zero.
